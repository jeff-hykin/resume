            The outcomes are really impressive (bat hearing, dog smelling) so much is possible with simple logic on top of these worlds of perceptions. But I can't help but think robotic sensors pale in comparison -- so badly as to make mimicking most of the behavior impossible.

    The Ecological Approach for visual perception:

            Harry Heft did a pretty good job of summarizing the ideas in this paper.
            Lots of the ideas are philosophical with a bit of a gap on how to implement them.

            Interesting, but wouldn't be practical for me to replicate or use for anything in practice.

            1. Things in the environment are a modifier function on the transformation of your motion through the world. Ex: a disco ball changes your visual feedback as you walk. If both stand still, then there's no modification. When our estimation of that modifier function converges and becomes reliable, then we are fully perceiving that thing. E.g. when we know what the back of a couch looks like by seeing the front, we are perceiving the couch. When we are surprised, then we didn't fully perceive it. This “am I having a stroke image is all-sensing no-perceiving
            (see image in doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iIInU8a6Vtvp77xJAIvQpRbHw36JBvdOKkETXYm7bno/edit?tab=t.0 )
            2. Objects might be in the same category (tree) but for us they fall in many functional categories, such as “can I easily climb it” where things like “how annoying is the sap” can play a role. The climb-ability is in the tree, but is relative to the perceiver.

        summary: |
            S2 TL;DR: This review discusses the growing use of machine learning: from pose estimation, kinematic analyses, dimensionality reduction, and closed-loop feedback, to its use in understanding neural correlates and untangling sensorimotor systems.

            Does directly tie motors with perception.
